Privacy Policy
Effective Date: September 27, 2023

This Privacy Policy describes how HRBeauty LLC, dba Veecla and our brands and subsidiaries (“Veecla”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collect, use and share information about you. This policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, apps, shop in our online stores or otherwise interact with us as described below (collectively, the “Site”). We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy, and in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the homepages of our websites or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in our Terms of Service.

 

Acceptance Of These Terms

By using this Site, you signify your acceptance of this policy and any changes to this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.

 

Collection Of Information

We collect information from you directly, automatically when you visit the Sites, and sometimes from third parties. Some of this information may be considered "Personal Information" or “Personal Data,” and some of which may be considered “sensitive,” under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name, phone number, email address), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as "personal information" where required by applicable law. And, if we combine information that we consider to be non-personal with personal information, we will treat that combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. Note that we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as a "hash". We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. 

Information You Provide to Us. We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you use our websites, shop in our online stores, call us on the phone, create an online account, join our subscription and loyalty programs, sign up to receive our emails, participate in a sweepstakes, contest, promotion or survey, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support, apply for a job or otherwise communicate with us. This Site collects information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device. The types of Personal Information we may collect includes your name, email address, zip code, billing address, shipping address, phone number, payment card information, product preferences, demographic information and any other information you choose to provide. In some cases, we may also collect information you provide about others, such as when you purchase a gift card for someone and request that we deliver it electronically, create and share a “wish list” or decide to purchase and ship products to someone. We will use this information to fulfill your requests and may also use that information to send marketing communications to your contact, unless he or she has previously opted out of marketing communications from Veecla.

Information We Collect Automatically. We automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use our websites or transact business with us, including: (i) information about your use of our websites, such as the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the referring link through which you accessed our websites; (ii) information about the transaction, such as product details and the date and location of the purchase/return; and (iii) we may use cookies, web beacons, also known as “tracking pixels”) and other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you interact with our websites or emails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. We may combine this information with other information we collect about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving our websites and your online experience, understanding which areas and features of our sites are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our communications with you, determining whether an email has been opened and links within the email have been clicked and for other internal business purposes.

Retention and Transfer of Personal Information.  We retain Personal Information that you provide us as long as we consider it potentially useful in contacting you about our products and services, or as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date if you so request by unsubscribing, opting-out, or emailing us at veeclaconcept@gmail.com. Personal Information may be transferred and stored to secure servers in the United States.

 

Use Of Information 

We may use information about you for various purposes, including to: (i) facilitate and improve your online shopping experience; (ii) provide the products and services you request, process transactions and send you related information, including confirmations and receipts; (iii) respond to your comments, questions and requests and provide customer service; (iv) communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events and provide news and information we think will be of interest to you; (v) manage your online account(s) and send you technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages; (vi) personalize your online experience and provide advertisements, content or features that match your profile and interests; (vii) monitor and analyze trends, usage and activities; (viii) process and deliver contest, promotion and sweepstakes entries and rewards; (ix) link or combine with information we get from others to help understand your needs and provide you with better service; and (x) carry out any other purpose for which the information was collected. We are based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using our websites or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in and to the U.S. and other countries.

Text marketing: With your permission, we may send text messages about our store, new products, and other updates. Updates include Checkout Reminders. Webhooks will be used to trigger the Checkout Reminders messaging system.

 

Your Information Choices and Control

Veecla respects your need to access and control your Personal Information, so we give you certain choices that you may exercise, including:

You may correct, update, and delete your account.
You may change your choices for subscriptions, newsletters, and alerts.
You may choose whether to receive from us offers and promotions for our products and services, or products and services that we think may be of interest to you.
You may request access to the Personal Information we hold about you and that we amend or delete it. Please note that we may be required to keep such information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but residual copies may remain in our Site’s back-up systems due to the nature of those systems’ operations.
We may also retain your information for fraud or similar purposes.
You can exercise these controls and choose to opt in or out of services and communications through the website or following the instructions directly provided in the communications we send you. Please email <b>veeclaconcept@gmail.com</b> if you need assistance.

 

Sharing of Information

We may share information about you as follows: (i) with vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf; (ii) in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation; (iii) if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of us or any third party; (iv) in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company; or (v) with your consent or at your direction. We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you. We do not share your personal information that we have collected directly from you on our Site with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless you have consented (either through an opt-in our opt-out opportunity) at the time you provide your personal information.

 

Advertising and Analytics 

We engage third parties to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of our websites, such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our websites and other websites and better understand your online or offline activity. We may also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of a customized campaign on other websites or platforms. For a detailed description of the ways in which we and third parties collect information automatically and how it is used, please see our Cookie Policy.

Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

When sensitive information (such as a credit card data) is collected on our Site it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol and may be processed by third parties using similar levels of protection. Regardless of the precautions we take, no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure.
